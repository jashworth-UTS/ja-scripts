remember to use/get better at using:
	sapply
	tapply
	%in%
	merge
	duplicated
	locator (interactive plot clicking--e.g. selecting things to identify them, put them in lists, apply analyses to them, etc?)

save and clean useful histories for later reference and use as scripts
(also) write RData

to debug cMonkey errors:
	> options(error=recover)
	> cmonkey(e,dont.init=T)
